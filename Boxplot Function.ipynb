    "The box and whisker plot was created in 1970 by John W Tukey. John W Tukey was an American mathematician. Mr. Tukey developed important theories about how to analyze data and compute series of numbers quickly. He spent decades as both a professor at Princeton University and a researcher at AT&T's Bell Laboratories, and his ideas continue to be a part of both doctoral statistics courses and high school math classes [[Tukey]](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/28/us/john-tukey-85-statistician-coined-the-word-software.html?pagewanted=print)"

    "A boxplot is a graph that gives you a good indication of how the values in the data are spread out. Although box lots may seem primitive in comparison to a histogram or density plot, they have the advantage of taking up less space, which is useful when comparing distributions between many groups or datasets.[[Data]](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-boxplots-5e2df7bcbd51)\n",

    "1 Box and whisker plots handle large data effortlessly, but they do not retain the exact values and the details of the results of the distribution. These graphs allow a clear summary of large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Due to the five-number data summary, a box plot can handle and present a summary of a large amount of data. A box plot consists of the median, which is the midpoint of the range of data; the upper and lower quartiles, which represent the numbers above and below the highest and lower quarters of the data and the minimum and maximum data values. Organizing data in a box plot by using five key concepts is an efficient way of dealing with large data too unmanageable for other graphs, such as line plots or stem and leaf plots.\n",

    "5 A box plot is one of very few statistical graph methods that show outliers.There might be one outlier or multiple outliers within a set of data, which occurs both below and above the minimum and maximum data values. By extending the lesser and greater data values to a max of 1.5 times the inter-quartile range, the box plot delivers outliers or obscure results. Any results of data that fall outside of the minimum and maximum values known as outliers are easy to determine on a box plot graph.
